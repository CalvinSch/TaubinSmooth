Project 3 - Taubin Smoothing
Calvin Schaul
CS657/718 Advanced Computer Graphics and Animation

Code written in the `proj3_taubin_schaul.cpp` file. Based on smoothing.cpp demo code

Using 100 iterations of Taubin Smoothing, the result is seen in `output.off`

- Compile code with g++
`g++ proj3_taubin_schaul.cpp`
- Run the exe
`a.exe` or `./a.out` depending on windows/linux

Further research was done to complete this project.
